Notes
Method to create new user only accessible when already 
logged in to prevent customers from creating accounts. 

Initial idea of changing the amount in stock was removed as 
the products are not actually being sold, only getting as far 
as into the basket, so stock levels shouldn't change. 

Console table removed as it wasn't necessary to create pages on
selling games as I initially thought. This would only be needed
if the website sold consoles as well as games.
